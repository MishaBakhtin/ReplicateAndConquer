# ReplicateAndConquer
This game was created by Misha Bakhtin and Aric Obaidur

We are freshmen at Monta Vista High School and we created this game for a Java Project, where we had to create an educational game. The idea of Replicate & Conquer was roaming in our mind long before the project started, so we knew what we wanted from this. It took us 5 weeks, a lot of pain and stress to create the game so that you could enjoy it. So, please, have fun!
